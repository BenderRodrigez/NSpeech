This project created as a part of my master's research work. It contain an algorithms that was used in my work.
Currently supported features:

1. Digital signal processing;
2. Dictor's voiceprint generation based on Pitch, Linerar Prediction or these combination and Vector Quantisation;
3. Speaker verification by Picth and Linear Prediction.

Known limitations:
1. May not work with sounds with small vowels count;
2. May work slow for too long voice samples (I recomend to not use phrases longer than 1 sentence);
3. Verification based on Linear Prediction not working right now.
