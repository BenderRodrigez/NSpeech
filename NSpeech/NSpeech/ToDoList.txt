/*TO-DO LIST:
* Add all basic signal features (like autocorrelation or average zero line corssings count);
+	* Additive noise generator;
+	* Voiced speech intervals detector;
+	* Start/stop speech detector;
+	* Linear predict coefficients;
+	* Pitch;
+	* Fix all descriptions, made some refactoring;
	* Maybe cepstrum (MFCC);
+* Make some descidion about speech signal representation;
+* Add speech features (pitch, LPC);
+* Make dictor's model;
+* Add vector quantisation algorithm as dictor model learning algorithm;

Time to think about the tests
