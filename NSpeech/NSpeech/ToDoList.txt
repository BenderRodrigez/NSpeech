/*TO-DO LIST:
* Add all basic signal features (like autocorrelation or average zero line corssings count);
+	* Additive noise generator;
	* Voiced speech intervals detector;
	* Start/stop speech detector;
	* Linear predict coefficients;
	* Pitch;
	* Maybe cepstrum (MFCC);
* Make some descidion about speech signal representation;
* Add speech features (pitch, LPC);
* Make dictor's model;
* Add vector quantisation algorithm as dictor model learning algorithm;
* Should this framework dealth with DB storages or somthing like that to store dictor's models and reuse it or not?
